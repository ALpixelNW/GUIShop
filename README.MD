<h2><a id="user-content-why-you-should-use-it" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/drtshock/Essentials#why-you-should-use-it" aria-hidden="true"></a>What is GUIShop</h2>
<p>GUIShop adds a basic shop system to your server via Chest GUI's. You can buy &amp; sell items for any preset value. You can enchant &amp; rename any item which will be applied to the item upon purchase.</p>
<p>GUIShop is almost self-sufficient. However, it still has requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>GUIShop requires&nbsp;<a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/">Vault</a>&nbsp;to enable the plugin to hook into your economly so it can withdraw/deposit cash into your player's accounts.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>GUIShop requires Java 8+.</strong></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>GUIShop can easily be compiled by cloning this repository to a folder, navigating to the folder in your command prompt/terminal and running:</p>
<pre><code>mvn clean install
</code><code>
</code></pre>
<p>The Jar file can then be found in the /target folder.</p>

<p>This is the official fork for GUIShop. It will be consistently updated with the latest Minecraft and Spigot versions. This means support for older Minecraft versions will be limited but still offered.</p>
